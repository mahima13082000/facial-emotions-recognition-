# facial-emotions-recognition (ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜”ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜§ðŸ˜¡)
Overview
This project focuses on building a robust image recognition system using deep learning techniques. The system is capable of identifying various objects, scenes, and patterns within images. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models to achieve high accuracy in object detection and classification tasks.


Features
Object detection and classification in images.
Real-time image recognition using webcam or video streams.
Integration with cloud-based services for large-scale image processing.



Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy


Usage
Image Recognition: Use the image_recognition.py script to perform image recognition on individual images. You can specify the input image file and the desired pre-trained model.

Real-time Recognition: Run the real_time_recognition.py script to activate the webcam and perform real-time image recognition.

Customization: Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific requirements. You can experiment with different pre-trained models, fine-tune existing models, or integrate additional functionalities.



Pre-trained Models

Pre-trained models for image recognition are provided in the models directory. You can use these models out-of-the-box or train your own models using custom datasets.
